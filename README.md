Black Friday Sales Prediction using Machine Learning
Overview
This project utilizes scikit-learn to predict Black Friday sales, providing retailers with valuable insights into customer preferences. Multiple machine learning models were implemented, with the random forest regressor outperforming others, yielding a Mean Squared Error (MSE) score of 0.77.

Features
Sales Prediction: Predicts sales for Black Friday using historical data.
Customer Insights: Provides valuable insights into customer preferences and buying behavior.
Model Comparison: Implements and compares several machine learning models to find the best predictor.
Performance Metrics: Evaluates models using Mean Squared Error (MSE) to determine prediction accuracy.
Tools and Techniques
scikit-learn: Python library used for implementing machine learning models.
Random Forest Regressor: The best-performing model for this project, providing the lowest MSE.
Data Preprocessing: Techniques for cleaning and preparing data for model training.
Model Evaluation: Utilizes MSE to evaluate and compare model performance.
